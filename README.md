# Code of Conduct

“ZA Developers” in this document refers to the ZA Developers Slack organization at [https://zadevelopers.slack.com/](https://zadevelopers.slack.com/). “The administrators” refers to the administrators on this organization, a [list is available at the top of the Team Directory](https://zadevelopers.slack.com/team) (must be a member of the organization to view).

ZA Developers is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

This code of conduct applies to all ZA Developers spaces, including public channels, private channels and direct messages, both online and off. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from these spaces at the discretion of the administrators.

Some ZA Developers spaces may have additional rules in place, which will be made clearly available to participants. Participants are responsible for knowing and abiding by these rules.

Harassment includes:

* Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion
* Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment.
* Deliberate misgendering or use of “dead” or rejected names
* Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour in spaces where they’re not appropriate
* Physical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like “hug” or “backrub”) without consent or after a request to stop.
* Threats of violence
* Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm
* Deliberate intimidation
* Stalking or following
* Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes
* Sustained disruption of discussion
* Unwelcome sexual attention
* Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others
* Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease
* Deliberate “outing” of any aspect of a person’s identity without their consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional abuse
* Publication of non-harassing private communication

# Reporting

If you are being harassed by a member of ZA Developers, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please [contact an admin](https://zadevelopers.slack.com/team) directly via DM. Administrators will respond as soon as they are able. If the person who is harassing you is on the management team, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident.

This code of conduct applies to ZA Developers spaces, but if you are being harassed by a member of ZA Developers outside our spaces, we still want to know about it. We will take all good-faith reports of harassment by ZA Developers members, especially the administrators, seriously. This includes harassment outside our spaces and harassment that took place at any point in time. The abuse team reserves the right to exclude people from ZA Developers based on their past behavior, including behavior outside ZA Developers spaces and behavior towards people who are not members of the ZA Developers community.

In order to protect volunteers from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith. Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without response.

We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we’ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of ZA Developers members or the general public. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.

# Consequences

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the administrators may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from all ZA Developers spaces and identification of the participant as a harasser to other ZA Developers members and/or the general public.

# Changes
This code of conduct is subject to change as circumstances require, all current members of the ZA Developers community will be notified through the [#code-of-conduct](https://zadevelopers.slack.com/messages/code-of-conduct/) channel prior to these changes taking effect.
